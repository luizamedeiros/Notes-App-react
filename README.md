# Notes app made with React

This project was made as a course project, and it's my first time using React!
The user can write their own categories to add to the notes, which have a title and content. User's categories are added to and chosen from a dropdown list.
Notes can also be deleted.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
